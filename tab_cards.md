## Get the Cards

<img src="assets/images/Cornucopia-square-logo-350" alt="OWASP Cornucopia deck and cards" class="fa-pull-right" style="margin:0 0 1em 2em;">

The primary source document is a [Word document](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-cornucopia/tree/master/assets/files/ecommerce/EN). However, pre-printed card decks may be more useful, or there are links to the source design files for the cards themselves.

### Printed

Professionally printed decks are available by two methods:

* Single decks or in bulk from OWASP (v1.20)
 * As promotion items by OWASP Leaders from their own chapter budgets using the [Chapter and Project Merchandise Request form](https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSez9mV97HuqvYhCldE2hYhX3UjQM1oO5bLy44HkOZSpni0OzQ/viewform?formkey=dF85bGtvdWdrd2JjYldNZ1gxSkJxaEE6MQ)
 * For other individuals, organisations and companies, please email [lisa.jones@owasp.com](mailto:lisa.jones@owasp.com) with purchase inquiries.
